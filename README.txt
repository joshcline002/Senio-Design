This project has to do with the creation of a wearable device. This device will be able todetect back posture as well as back muscle acitivity. It should use a micro controller andvarious sensors to do this. This information will be sent to a mobile device where it can beviewed and used. The mobile device needs an application developed to use the information provided to it.
