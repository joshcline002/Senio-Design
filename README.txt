This project has to do with the creation of a wearable device. This device will be able to
detect back posture as well as back muscle acitivity. It should use a micro controller and
various sensors to do this. This information will be sent to a mobile device where it can be
viewed and used. The mobile device needs an application developed to use the information 
provided to it.
